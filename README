# Building
You need to install stack (https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), then inside
the cloned repo :

`stack build`

The binary's path should be given at the end, something like this in my case :

`.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux/lts-6.26/7.10.3/bin/cstodo`

# Devel
You can use

`stack exec -- yesod devel`

to start a development server that will recompile at each change in the sources
and start the binary on port 3000.
